                    <p>I have been blessed to know and love Sarah for my entire existence. However, if we’re REALLY
                        being honest, she has been blessed to know and love ME for most of HER existence. My big sister
                        was my first friend and to this day I’m still so honored to call her my best friend. I tell
                        anyone who will listen that my sister is the most kind hearted, gracious, beautiful, and joyful
                        angel that ever fell on this earth. I can state this as a fact, because in 24 years I have seen
                        every side of her. Sarah is one of the most precious things that I know on this earth—more
                        precious than any rare stone or metal and more meaningful than any friendship I’ve ever had
                        (Sorry guys). I never knew I could love someone so much and I’m blessed to know that this love
                        is being returned tenfold. My sister is truly my heart and I am over the world excited that God
                        has blessed her with such a wonderful partner to share her life with.</p>

                    <p>My sister and I have visited over nine countries together and counting! We have jumped into
                        oceans screaming at the top of our lungs, tried to sneak into dance clubs before I was 21, and
                        even took a vacation to the Niagra Falls on the way to our actual vacation (lol!). My sister
                        and I bring out the best and most honest parts of each other and I couldn’t ask for a grander
                        sister to share life with. My fondest memories of my sister are all the adventures we have been
                        on—from Miami to Dubai it has always been a joyous time! I am so excited for this next chapter
                        of her life.</p>

                    <p>love you so much big seeeester!</p>

                    <p>Sarah and I met freshman year at Oral Roberts University. We were a group of 5 girls who really
                        clicked and our relationship just blossomed throughout the years. We have been connected since
                        then and it has been 10 years now. We’ve grown closer each year. I’m glad God connected us
                        because we have been there for each other in every situation. We’ve cried together, laughed,
                        prayed, supported, been silly together and have gone through so much together. I thank God for
                        giving me a sister from another mother. I’m so excited God gave her the man of her dreams to
                        partner with throughout life. I can’t wait to celebrate them! </p>
                    <p>One of my fondest memories that comes to mind was during freshman year; we both were nursing
                        majors at the time and would pull all-nighters to study. Sarah has always been a busy body ;
                        involved with so many school extracurricular activities on top of our very busy schedule. Every
                        time we tried to study she would sit at her desk with her glasses on like an “old lady “ and
                        she would fall asleep. Khortnie and I would say “Sarah wake up, you are supposed to be
                        studying!!” While still sleeping she always responded “leave me alone I’m not asleep, I’m just

                    <p>In 2009, fate brought Sarah and me together as roommates at Oral Roberts University. Starting
                        off as strangers, if we could manage to live together and conquer freshman year, then we were
                        destined to be great friends. Throughout that first school year alone, our bond grew strong as
                        we worked through our differences and discovered the ying-&-yang balance of our friendship.
                        Even as God led us to attend and graduate from different universities, Sarah still remained a
                        dependable, constant friend who has always encouraged me to be my best.</p>

                    <p>Some of my fondest memories with Sarah include going to various concerts. One of the first
                        things we ever did together during freshman year was attend a concert and from that point on I
                        knew Sarah’s high energy & infectious enthusiasm made her the best person to enjoy dancing,
                        screaming, & singing (though she never knows all the lyrics) with at concerts. Sarah’s
                        good-natured & motivating personality isn’t reserved just for concerts, I have witnessed Sarah
                        take a compassionate approach to everyone she encounters. Whether family, friend, foe, or a
                        complete stranger- Sarah is always ready to lift a helping hand & speak words of encouragement
                        to everyone she meets. So, whether we were simply meeting for local burgers in OKC, taking a
                        vacation trip to another city, or just having a brief phone conversation- anytime I get to
                        hangout with Sarah I know I’ll leave our encounter in a happier mindset because Sarah’s
                        joyfulness is contagious.</p>

                    <p>Over the past almost 10 years, we have worked to fostered a faith-based genuine friendship
                        that’s so strong we can’t just call each other “friends”, but rather “soul-sisters” with a
                        lifelong unbreakable bond. And over the past decade I have had the privilege to witness Sarah
                        develop into a warm-hearted leader, prayer-warrior, superhero nurse, and shining light in any
                        dark situation. That’s why I know she’ll make a phenomenal wife (and one day a mother too) and
                        I am over-joyed to to celebrate in her union to become Mrs. Ofodire. And I look forward
                        expectantly to see where God will lead & bless Sarah within the next decade & beyond in our
                        friendship.

                        cultivated and nurtured our friendship bringing us closer together since that faithful night.
                        I'm truly blessed and honored not only to call her my friend but also my sister as well. Sarah
                        has a sweet,lively spirit and a golden heart to match. She is always there to support others
                        with her cheerful and joyful presence! I will never forget our study days in the library where
                        we had so many wonderful memories, from all the laughter to our banana and peanut butter snack
                        breaks lol. We have shared a lifetime of memories and will continue to create more lasting
                        moments.</p>

                    <p> I'm super thrilled for you and Chisom and can't wait to celebrate you both on your special day!
                        May God continue to richly bless your beautiful union! As you walk through this journey,
                        remember to always put Christ first at the center of your marriage.

                        came to my house to attend a Woman of Purpose meeting that I hosted and she was such a breath
                        of fresh air. From that moment on Sarah has been apart of my life and our friendship grew into

                        peaceful woman that brings endless joy into the lives of others. I know your marriage will be

                    <p>Our mothers are close friends, so Sarah had an older, wiser, and taller sister from birth. From
                        spending days together as children being watched by her grandmother, to the much cherished
                        catch-ups in between our busy schedules, our friendship has been a constant in my life that has
                        grown and developed into something more and more beautiful as the years progress. One thing I
                        love about us is that no matter where we’re led in life... no matter how much time has passed..
                        whenever we get together it’s ALWAYS as if we’re picking up right where we left off. The laughs
                        just as exuberant, the stories and life revelations just as heartfelt.
                    </p>

                    <p>I have many memories with our Sarah! One favorite from childhood is when we discarded our “good
                        girl” personas for a night, broke glass bottles in the parking lot of a Nigerian party, and got
                        caught by a police officer (Mommy.. Aunty.. if you’re reading this, we’re sorry ohhh! LOL).
                        Another is when we road tripped together to Austin last year and I got to see this girl in a
                        new light.
                    </p>

                    <p>To say that I’m honored to add being her bridesmaid to this list is an understatement!

                    <p>So it all began a long time ago, 11 years back, when I first moved to Texas and met my Sista.
                        Our relationship started at a church where our families both attended. Over the years our
                        friendship began to develop to become more than just friends making Sarah become my, “little
                        munchkin mini-me firecracker loyal right-hand sister family in Christ!”
                        Sarah will probably be the day she got engaged! What a pivotal mark in her life and such an
                        amazing testimony that I was able to witness. Sarah, I love you so much and I say this all the

                    <p>There are too many fond memories of Sarah from chasing each other down the streets to crying
                        alongside each other. I can remeber the conversations about relationships how and God ordained
                        it should be but at the same time yet so foreign. But my friend, look at God oh!! Won't he do
                        it!! Sarah is one special person and I know that Chisom is way beyond blessed to have even have
                        gotten a chance to capture a gem like Sarah. If I can place Sarah in my purse and carry her
                        everywhere I go I would because her joy is contagious, her love for God is real, her compassion
                        and love is incomparable, her laugh is contagious and loud (like mine), her friendship is
                        genuine and is one in a million. One thing I know is that, whether near or far, Sarah will
                        always be there.</p>
                    <p>With much love, I’m your biggest fan! (literally)

                        heard about them versus who they actually are. I was on the look out for my brother and
                        fortunately my expectations weren't cut short! She was lively, friendly, playful,....and we

                        had someone to hook me up with lol. I'm so happy for Sarah and Chisom. </p>

                        head belonged to that of a Nigerian. So I said hello, introduced myself and found out I was
                        right. That same afternoon he came to my apartment and ate my moms Ghanaian jollof and the rest
                        is history! From day one, I saw a friendliness in him which made him approachable because I am
                        not one to usually initiate conversations. Over the years, I’ve come to know him as a deeply
                        loyal and respectable friend. He is humorous and intelligent and shares that part of him with
                        everyone. He is committed to his dreams and people around him which sets him up for a bright

                    <p>My name is Chief Nnaemeka Chidike Ofodire, the Native Dr. in the Family and the youngest brother
                        of the groom!
                    </p>

                    <p>I have known Chisom for 26+ years, there were rumors in August 1992 that if they had allowed
                        him, Chisom would have been the OBGYN to yank me out of my mother. Praise the Lord for
                        restriction :).
                    </p>

                    <p>Junior, as I fondly call him, is and has always been my role model. I try to be like Jesus or my
                        father, but those ones are life journeys. As the first born, he was the first to walk into
                        uncharted territory and he excelled. From being the Head boy in primary school to becoming a
                        resident doctor and marrying the girl of his dreams, he has shown us how to live by example.
                    </p>

                    <p>Don’t be fooled, Chisom ain’t perfect, he still sleeps and eats at the same time, and would work
                        another graveyard shift to enhance his hustle. But all of this will change now that he has met
                        his beautiful rib, Chidinma, the one that makes him smile like a rabbit.
                    </p>
                    <p>I am so proud of you and Chidinma and we cannot wait to shaku shaku with you and come back 9
                        months from Aug 10, 2019 for another round! Happy Married Life Sarah&Chisom!!!

                    <p>My name is Daniel Asonye. I am Sarah’s older brother. I honestly met Chisom during an
                        unannounced FaceTime call while I was coming out of one my classes in the Spring of 2018, when
                        my sister introduced her “special friend”, but I had already knew what it was all about.
                    </p>

                    <p>When we officially met, last October , we embraced each other like we were long lost brothers.
                        We spent that night helping the ladies in the kitchen prepare meat pies that we all loved so
                        much .
                    </p>

                    <p>I’m a very good judge of character, and I know my sister very well. I don’t think I have ever
                        seen her as happy as she is now. I’m beyond blessed God brought you two together. I wish you
                        two nothing but the best. </p>

                    <p>In November 2006, I met Chisom and his family in Sacramento, CA at a church event. I was fresh
                        off the boat and knew no one so he was one of the first friends I made in the US. Although our
                        career paths were different, we spent some time discussing educational institutions, career
                        paths and life in general. We have remained friends since then.</p>

                    <p>I am so glad he is living a life of his dreams in his career and more importantly his
                        relationship with Sarah. Since I live in Dallas, I got the chance to meet Sarah before y’all.
                        In my 1st interaction with Sarah, she was warm, sweet, friendly and funny. I was a big
                        supporter of this union since day one and I am so happy for Sarah and Chisom.

                        Simply translated from Igbo to mean- a friend that is greater than a brother

                    </p>

                    <p>I first met Chisom in the fall of 2013 when we were in our first year of medical school and we
                        have been like brothers ever since. I really couldn't have asked for a more genuine and
                        trustworthy person to call a friend. Words will fail me in my attempt to describe Chisom and
                        unfortunately a little piece on this website won't do it justice either.
                        However, if there is a word
                    </p>

                    <p>I’d like to use to describe him, it would be “Cheerful”. I have yet to find anyone quite as full
                        of cheer and lights up a room like this kid. Even in the face of challenging circumstances, he
                        has always remained a steady source of cheer to everyone around him. If you’ve met Chisom well
                        then you’ll know what I’m talking about.
                    </p>

                    <p>I am blessed to call him a friend and was very excited to hear that he found Sarah as his
                        soulmate. My prayer is that God will continue to bless this union and make them a beacon of
                        light to their generation. I cannot wait to celebrate this big day with you two.

                    <p>My name is Russell Oyewole and I met Dr. Chisom Ofodire (unofficially) for the first time in the
                        winter of 2006. We eventfully crossed paths in the parking of a Target store where I was
                        working as a cart attendant; the rest is history.

                    </p>

                    <p>Dr. Chisom is a brother, brother in Christ, pal, buddy, friend, monopoly game partner, academic
                        motivator, bandmate, personal physicians (pro bono) and inside jokes comrade. It is a difficult
                        task to write in brevity about Chisom because of how many memories we’ve established over the
                        years. I remember several times we’ve “played surgeon”; we would reenact a surgery scene from
                        washing our hands, putting on gloves, walking into the imaginary theatre backwards, and calling
                        out surgical procedures. I recall several mock debates we’ve had; political debates, debates
                        about politics, presidential political debates, and debates about everything else. I recount
                        the several menial jobs we’ve undertaken; tossing newspapers, being lifeguards, 5linx (my
                        income). I can’t the forget the countless hours of studying at the infamous JEFJEN which as
                        culminated to the title of Doctor. I’m grateful for the opportunities we were given to know and
                        receive Jesus as Lord and savior; this crucial relationship set the foundation and course for
                        our lives.
                    </p>

                    <p>We’ve spoken several times, even joked of the notion of marriage; who will get married first,
                        what kind of gal will we marry etc and I’m ecstatic the moment is here. Thank you for choosing
                        me to be a groomsman.
                    </p>
                    <p>Congratulation my brother on your marriage, I hope to continue to be a part of your new family
                        (you and lovely Chidinma). Praying that your union will begin with God and be sustained by God
                        until the End.

                        a lot about her, but sometimes until you meet someone, its hard to really merge what you've
                        heard about them versus who they actually are. I was on the look out for my brother and
                        fortunately my expectations weren't cut short! She was lively, friendly, playful,....and we

                    <p>At first I didn't know how to feel about my sister getting married but once I met Chisom I knew
                        he was the right one for my sister. One thing I can say about Chisom is that I can see the love
                        he has for Sarah sister by the way he values her. I know what I have observed is authentic and
                        genuine. I'm so blessed to see them grow together in the Lord.</p>
