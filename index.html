                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <h4>Sarah’s Story:</h4>
                    <p>It all began with one phone call. As cliche as it sounds, I really do remember it like it was
                        yesterday. It was the Summer of 2017 and I was getting ready to travel to Boston for a
                        convention the following day. I was packing my belongings, when I received a phone call from my
                        wonderful aunt Mrs. Priscilla Madu, who periodically calls to check in on me. My Aunty doesn’t
                        beat around the bush and quickly uttered those magical words that I have heard so often: “Are
                        you dating anyone?” I laughed and listened to what she had to tell me. I told her I would pray
                        over our discussion and get back to her before I traveled. Like with any decision, I prayed and
                        I pursued the peace of God. The decision to give my contact information to her wasn’t hard
                        because I respect and trust my Aunty’s sound judgement and knew she only wants the best for me.</p>

                    <p>
                        A few days after I arrive home from my trip, I get a text at work from an unknown number. It
                        read, “Hello is this Chidinma?” and I thought to myself, “Who is this person calling me by my
                        Igbo name?!” Later that evening, Chisom calls me, and my first thought was “This guy sounds
                        like an African Uncle!” Thankfully, I was able to get passed his voice and listen to what he
                        had to tell me and now his voice is one of my favorite sounds to hear. I am not joking when I
                        say that we talked for nearly 4 hours that night! Those who know me, know I don’t like talking
                        on the phone, unless we have not spoken in a while. So for Chisom to keep me engaged in
                        conversation was only by the special grace of God. After our conversation, I knew this guy was
                        going to be someone special in my life. We had so much in common, and I felt like I could talk
                        to him about anything. He was so open and non-judgmental and we laughed the entire night. One
                        particular, random line that I will never forget him asking me (sorry, Nkem I have to tell it)
                        was “Would you rather be eaten by a lion or a hyena?” I thought that was SOOOO random, but I am
                        super random as well... so I knew that it was the start to a beautiful beginning.

                        Fast forward to September 2017, my family and I traveled to Sacramento for the Okwuosa 25th
                        wedding anniversary (my Dad and Aunty Chisorom are cousins). Chisom’s family is based in
                        Sacramento, but at the time Chisom was living in Chicago. During this period, Chisom and I were
                        still just friends and he knew I planned to travel soon but not to Sacramento. At the wedding
                        reception, my sister and I were enjoying our food from cocktail hour and walking back to our
                        assigned table when a lady suddenly, but gently, grabs my elbow and says “I know who you are!”
                        In my head I’m thinking “Ummm, this is awkward,” but I play along and say, “Ohhh, yes Aunty you
                        look so familiar! Are you from Dallas as well?” I ask her for her name, but she bypasses the
                        question then proceeds to ask me what my name is. I eventually give in since it is an unspoken
                        agreement that everyone at the wedding is unofficially your Aunty. I say “Aunty, my name is
                        Chidinma” thinking she would be pleased to hear my Igbo name. She said “No, what is your other
                        name?” I nervously laugh to myself and think, “Ah ah! What is going on here?” I tell her my
                        name is “Sarah” and this huge smile comes on her face like she just won the jackpot. She then
                        asks me to go with her to take pictures, and once again in my head I am like “No disrespect
                        Aunty, but you won’t even let me know your name, or who you are how do I know what you’re gonna
                        do with my picture?” LOL! She comes back to our table 3 times, urging me to take the picture
                        before revealing her identity. My sister and I eventually guess who she is and under the
                        pressure of our discovery she finally confesses that she is Chisom’s aunt! My dear Aunty
                        Uchanma, I have grown to love and cherish you as if I have known you for years. Thank you for
                        being such a great detective that night and a loving aunty since then. In addition to that
                        evening, I met other members of Chisom’s family and all the while I had yet to meet Chisom,
                        himself.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To make this long story short, the following day I get a surprise text from an unknown number
                        and it turns out to be Aunty Uchanma inviting my family and I to come and have lunch with
                        Chisom’s family that <u>Sunday afternoon</u>. I was of course so shocked at how quickly
                        everything was
                        moving because I hadn’t even met Chisom yet! However, being the loving and welcoming family
                        that they were, Chisom’s family invited us over for lunch. We accepted the invitation and that
                        day I met Chisom’s entire immediate family( except his two brothers)—his parents, his sister,
                        cousins, etc. It was as if our families had known each other for years. The chemistry was there
                        and we felt so welcomed. I truly felt like I was at home. Fast forward to October, I met Chisom
                        for the first time on October 21st, 2017. When we met he was expecting it to be awkward, but
                        there was no awkward silence. We both chatted away like old time friends, I felt free, and had
                        complete peace.
                    </p>

                    <p>We have such an interesting and God led story and I wouldn’t want it any other way. I am so
                        excited to marry one of the most incredible, calm, loving, and thoughtful men I know. Chisom is
                        my calming wave to my rushing waters. The harmonic rhythm to my heartbeat and the love of my
                        life. Without effort, Chisom treats and cares for me like a queen. He makes me a priority and
                        spoils me with his unconditional love. I thank God almighty for allowing our paths to cross and
                        that God loved me so much that he gave me such a wonderful man to call my leader, my king, my
                        bestfriend, and my soulmate. I love you so much Chisom, thank you for pursuing my heart and
                        choosing me as your wife.</p>

                    <h4>Chisom’s Story</h4>
                    <p>When people ask me how I met Sarah, I always stop in wonderment. I wonder how in the world I was
                        so blessed and lucky to be getting married to the most beautiful woman that I have ever grown
                        to know. Sarah and I first met in October of 2017. We had just been introduced to each other
                        through our lovely aunties, Mrs Okorocha and Mrs. Madu. For months, I prayed to God for my
                        “Nkem,” and God and I laughed about my fantasy stories of how we would meet. In my mind’s eye,
                        I was going to meet her on a train or possibly at a bus-stop. God laughed and even now I can
                        admit that I must have been watching too many movies. Unbeknownst to me, my Nkem was coming in
                        an entirely different, yet equally marvelous, package.
                    </p>
                    <p>Let’s take things back a few months to my birthday in June of 2017. My aunt called to wish me a
                        happy birthday and in the middle of that congratulatory conversion, she initiated the typical
                        Nigerian aunty question:”so Chisom hmm, so when are you going to get married?" I laughed and
                        told her, “Aunty don't worry, she is coming.” "Exactly! she is coming," Aunty O replied. She
                        then told me about a woman named “Sarah.” At first, I thought she was joking about one of those
                        Bible stories, which would not be unusual given the relationship I have with my family members.
                        Before the end of the conversation, my interests were peaked and I asked for Sarah's phone
                        number. About a month later, we started talking on the phone and through text message. She
                        would ask me all these scenario questions, and I would answer to the best of my ability. We
                        realized quickly that we loved similar things. We both loved the Lord, we loved to travel, and
                        we both loved and cared deeply about our friends and family.</p>
                    <p>
                        When I was 10 years old, I shared the details of my vision for the kind of woman I wanted to
                        marry. My young 10 year old mind was so clear on my desires that I even noted where I wanted
                        her hometown to be. Years later, God granted me all of my wishes and answered every level of my
                        prayers. It was Sarah. 3 months after the initial "Hello,” I flew from Chicago, where I was
                        completing my last month of medical school, to Dallas, where I would meet Sarah for the first
                        time at DFW airport. I was already anticipating that awkward silence in the car as we left the
                        airport, but that never silence never came. We chatted like long lost friends and danced
                        throughout that ride. She was and still is, the goofiest, funniest, and most loving person I
                        have ever met. Our first official date was at the Texas State Fair in Dallas and before the day
                        was over, I knew that I couldn’t afford to not see her again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exactly one year after that first date, I came back again to ask her to spend the rest of her
                        life with me. She said YES! "Nkem,” as I fondly call her, is a gentle spirit, an open heart,
                        and a lover of everyone around her.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Come August 2019, by the special grace of God and in the presence of our friends and families,
                        I am super excited to get married to my bestie and future wife, Sarah Chidinma Asonye.

                    <p>I have been blessed to know and love Sarah for my entire existence. However, if we’re REALLY
                        being honest, she has been blessed to know and love ME for most of HER existence. My big sister
                        was my first friend and to this day I’m still so honored to call her my best friend. I tell
                        anyone who will listen that my sister is the most kind hearted, gracious, beautiful, and joyful
                        angel that ever fell on this earth. I can state this as a fact, because in 24 years I have seen
                        every side of her. Sarah is one of the most precious things that I know on this earth—more
                        precious than any rare stone or metal and more meaningful than any friendship I’ve ever had
                        (Sorry guys). I never knew I could love someone so much and I’m blessed to know that this love
                        is being returned tenfold. My sister is truly my heart and I am over the world excited that God
                        has blessed her with such a wonderful partner to share her life with.</p>

                    <p>My sister and I have visited over nine countries together and counting! We have jumped into
                        oceans screaming at the top of our lungs, tried to sneak into dance clubs before I was 21, and
                        even took a vacation to the Niagra Falls on the way to our actual vacation (lol!). My sister
                        and I bring out the best and most honest parts of each other and I couldn’t ask for a grander
                        sister to share life with. My fondest memory of my sister are all the adventures we have been
                        on—from Miami to Dubai it has always been a joyous time! I am so excited for this next chapter
                        of her life.</p>

                    <p>love you so much big seeeester!</p>

                    <p>Sarah and I met freshman year at Oral Roberts University. We were a group of 5 girls who really
                        clicked and our relationship just blossomed throughout the years. We have been connected since
                        then and it has been 10 years now. We’ve grown closer each year. I’m glad God connected us
                        because we have been there for each other in every situation. We’ve cried together, laughed,
                        prayed, supported, been silly together and have gone through so much together. I thank God for
                        giving me a sister from another mother. I’m so excited God gave her the man of her dreams to
                        partner with throughout life. I can’t wait to celebrate them! </p>
                    <p>One of my fondest memories that comes to mind was during freshman year; we both were nursing
                        majors at the time and would pull all-nighters to study. Sarah has always been a busy body ;
                        involved with so many school extracurricular activities on top of our very busy schedule. Every
                        time we tried to study she would sit at her desk with her glasses on like an “old lady “ and
                        she would fall asleep. Khortnie and I would say “Sarah wake up, you are supposed to be
                        studying!!” While still sleeping she always responded “leave me alone I’m not asleep, I’m just
                        resting my eyes!“</p>
                    <p>We always took pictures to show her the next day and afterwards we would take off her glasses
                        and put her to bed. </p>

                    <p>In 2009, fate brought Sarah and me together as roommates at Oral Roberts University. Starting
                        off as strangers, if we could manage to live together and conquer freshman year, then we were
                        destined to be great friends. Throughout that first school year alone, our bond grew strong as
                        we worked through our differences and discovered the ying-&-yang balance of our friendship.
                        Even as God led us to attend and graduate from different universities, Sarah still remained a
                        dependable, constant friend who has always encouraged me to be my best.</p>

                    <p>Some of my fondest memories with Sarah include going to various concerts. One of the first
                        things we ever did together during freshman year was attend a concert and from that point on I
                        knew Sarah’s high energy & infectious enthusiasm made her the best person to enjoy dancing,
                        screaming, & singing (though she never knows all the lyrics) with at concerts. Sarah’s
                        good-natured & motivating personality isn’t reserved just for concerts, I have witnessed Sarah
                        take a compassionate approach to everyone she encounters. Whether family, friend, foe, or a
                        complete stranger- Sarah is always ready to lift a helping hand & speak words of encouragement
                        to everyone she meets. So, whether we were simply meeting for local burgers in OKC, taking a
                        vacation trip to another city, or just having a brief phone conversation- anytime I get to
                        hangout with Sarah I know I’ll leave our encounter in a happier mindset because Sarah’s
                        joyfulness is contagious.</p>

                    <p>Over the past almost 10 years, we have worked to fostered a faith-based genuine friendship
                        that’s so strong we can’t just call each other “friends”, but rather “soul-sisters” with a
                        lifelong unbreakable bond. And over the past decade I have had the privilege to witness Sarah
                        develop into a warm-hearted leader, prayer-warrior, superhero nurse, and shining light in any
                        dark situation. That’s why I know she’ll make a phenomenal wife (and one day a mother too) and
                        I am over-joyed to to celebrate in her union to become Mrs. Ofodire. And I look forward
                        expectantly to see where God will lead & bless Sarah within the next decade & beyond in our
                        friendship.

                    <p>Sarah and I met for the first time at a Woman of Purpose Fellowship about 5 years ago. God
                        cultivated and nurtured our friendship bringing us closer together since that faithful night.
                        I'm truly blessed and honored not only to call her my friend but also my sister as well. Sarah
                        has a sweet,lively spirit and a golden heart to match. She is always there to support others
                        with her cheerful and joyful presence! I will never forget our study days in the library where
                        we had so many wonderful memories, from all the laughter to our banana and peanut butter snack
                        breaks lol. We have shared a lifetime of memories and will continue to create more lasting
                        moments.</p>

                    <p> I'm super thrilled for you and Chisom and can't wait to celebrate you both on your special day!
                        May God continue to richly bless your beautiful union! As you walk through this journey,
                        remember to always put Christ first at the center of your marriage.
                        Love you to pieces Sarah!

                    <p>Well, I met lovely Sarah in 2014 for the first time at my house. This lovely, beautiful stranger
                        came to my house to attend a Woman of Purpose meeting that I hosted and she was such a breath
                        of fresh air. From that moment on Sarah has been apart of my life and our friendship grew into
                        a sisterhood pretty quickly. I love the joy that Sarah has within her. When you come into
                        contact with Sarah, the joy simply overflows within your own heart. </p>

                    <p>Sarah will probably be the day she got engaged! What a pivotal mark in her life and such an
                        amazing testimony that I was able to witness. Sarah, I love you so much and I say this all the
                        time but I sincerely can’t wait to celebrate this day with you. You are such a wise and
                        peaceful woman that brings endless joy into the lives of others. I know your marriage will be
                        filled with nothing but joy, peace,and harmony from above. I love you loads boo!

                    <p>Our mothers are close friends, so Sarah had an older, wiser, and taller sister from birth. From
                        spending days together as children being watched by her grandmother, to the much cherished
                        catch-ups in between our busy schedules, our friendship has been a constant in my life that has
                        grown and developed into something more and more beautiful as the years progress. One thing I
                        love about us is that no matter where we’re led in life... no matter how much time has passed..
                        whenever we get together it’s ALWAYS as if we’re picking up right where we left off. The laughs
                        just as exuberant, the stories and life revelations just as heartfelt.
                    </p>

                    <p>I have many memories with our Sarah! One favorite from childhood is when we discarded our “good
                        girl” personas for a night, broke glass bottles in the parking lot of a Nigerian party, and got
                        caught by a police officer (Mommy.. Aunty.. if you’re reading this, we’re sorry ohhh! LOL).
                        Another is when we road tripped together to Austin last year and I got to see this girl in a
                        new light.
                    </p>

                    <p>To say that I’m honored to add being her bridesmaid to this list is an understatement!

                    <p>So it all began a long time ago, 11 years back, when I first moved to Texas and met my Sista.
                            Our relationship started at a church where our families both attended. Over the years our
                            friendship began to develop to become more than just friends making Sarah become my, “little
                            munchkin mini-me firecracker loyal right-hand sister family in Christ!” 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            There are too many fond
                            memories of Sarah from chasing each other down the streets to crying alongside each other. I
                            can remeber the conversations about relationships how and God ordained it should be but at
                            the same time yet so foreign. But my friend, look at God oh!! Won&#39;t he do it!! Sarah is one
                            special person and I know that Chisom is way beyond blessed to have even have gotten a
                            chance to capture a gem like Sarah. If I can place Sarah in my purse and carry her everywhere I
                            go I would because her joy is contagious, her love for God is real, her compassion and love is
                            incomparable, her laugh is contagious and loud (like mine), her friendship is genuine and is one
                            in a million. One thing I know is that, whether near or far, Sarah will always be there.

                    <p>With much love, I’m your biggest fan! (literally)

                    <p>I first met Sarah on a fateful Sunday in 2017 when she came to Cali with her family. I had heard
                        a lot about her, but sometimes until you meet someone, its hard to really merge what you've
                        heard about them versus who they actually are. I was on the look out for my brother and
                        fortunately my expectations weren't cut short! She was lively, friendly, playful,....and we
                        just clicked as though we had known each other for so long!
                    </p>

                    <p>Sarah has been awesome since the day I met her, however the first day we met still remains my
                        fondest memory of her. We laughed a lot that day, took pictures, made videos, and she already
                        had someone to hook me up with lol. I'm so happy for Sarah and Chisom. </p>

                    <p>Once upon a time during the first week of medical school, I saw a familiar anatomical head
                        walking to freshmen orientation. As I drew closer, I came to the conclusion the shape of the
                        head belonged to that of a Nigerian. So I said hello, introduced myself and found out I was
                        right. That same afternoon he came to my apartment and ate my moms Ghanaian jollof and the rest
                        is history! From day one, I saw a friendliness in him which made him approachable because I am
                        not one to usually initiate conversations. Over the years, I’ve come to know him as a deeply
                        loyal and respectable friend. He is humorous and intelligent and shares that part of him with
                        everyone. He is committed to his dreams and people around him which sets him up for a bright
                        future of impacting lives.

                        uncharted territory and he excelled. From being the Head boy in primary school to becoming a
                        resident doctor and marrying the girl of his dreams, he has shown us how to live by example.

                    <p>Don’t be fooled, Chisom ain’t perfect, he still sleeps and eats at the same time, and would work
                        another graveyard shift to enhance his hustle. But all of this will change now that he has met
                        his beautiful rib, Chidinma, the one that makes him smile like a rabbit.

                        We spent that night helping the ladies in the kitchen prepare meat pies that we all loved so

                        paths and life in general. We have remained friends since then.</p>

                    <p>I am so glad he is living a life of his dreams in his career and more importantly his
                        relationship with Sarah. Since I live in Dallas, I got the chance to meet Sarah before y’all.
                        In my 1st interaction with Sarah, she was warm, sweet, friendly and funny. I was a big
                        supporter of this union since day one and I am so happy for Sarah and Chisom.
                    </p>

                        Simply translated from Igbo to mean- a friend that is greater than a brother

                    </p>

                    <p>I first met Chisom in the fall of 2013 when we were in our first year of medical school and we
                        have been like brothers ever since. I really couldn't have asked for a more genuine and
                        trustworthy person to call a friend. Words will fail me in my attempt to describe Chisom and
                        unfortunately a little piece on this website won't do it justice either.
                        However, if there is a word
                    </p>

                    <p>I’d like to use to describe him, it would be “Cheerful”. I have yet to find anyone quite as full
                        of cheer and lights up a room like this kid. Even in the face of challenging circumstances, he
                        has always remained a steady source of cheer to everyone around him. If you’ve met Chisom well
                        then you’ll know what I’m talking about.
                    </p>

                    <p>I am blessed to call him a friend and was very excited to hear that he found Sarah as his
                        soulmate. My prayer is that God will continue to bless this union and make them a beacon of
                        light to their generation. I cannot wait to celebrate this big day with you two.

                    <p>My name is Russell Oyewole and I met Dr. Chisom Ofodire (unofficially) for the first time in the
                        winter of 2006. We eventfully crossed paths in the parking of a Target store where I was
                        working as a cart attendant; the rest is history.

                    </p>

                    <p>Dr. Chisom is a brother, brother in Christ, pal, buddy, friend, monopoly game partner, academic
                        motivator, bandmate, personal physicians (pro bono) and inside jokes comrade. It is a difficult
                        task to write in brevity about Chisom because of how many memories we’ve established over the
                        years. I remember several times we’ve “played surgeon”; we would reenact a surgery scene from
                        washing our hands, putting on gloves, walking into the imaginary theatre backwards, and calling
                        out surgical procedures. I recall several mock debates we’ve had; political debates, debates
                        about politics, presidential political debates, and debates about everything else. I recount
                        the several menial jobs we’ve undertaken; tossing newspapers, being lifeguards, 5linx (my
                        income). I can’t the forget the countless hours of studying at the infamous JEFJEN which as
                        culminated to the title of Doctor. I’m grateful for the opportunities we were given to know and
                        receive Jesus as Lord and savior; this crucial relationship set the foundation and course for
                        our lives.
                    </p>

                    <p>We’ve spoken several times, even joked of the notion of marriage; who will get married first,
                        what kind of gal will we marry etc and I’m ecstatic the moment is here. Thank you for choosing
                        me to be a groomsman.
                    </p>
                    <p>Congratulation my brother on your marriage, I hope to continue to be a part of your new family
                        (you and lovely Chidinma). Praying that your union will begin with God and be sustained by God
                        until the End.

                    <p>It&#39;s actually kinda funny because I remember back in January of 2018, my sister Chisom
                            told me that Sarah had a boyfriend and I thought she was just pulling my leg. I asked
                            Sarah and she kept denying it lol. Lo and behold 3 months later March of 2018 Chisom
                            and our family friends come to my parents house for a mini introduction. I looked at my
                            sister so crazy when I found out, I was shocked that my sister kept this secret for so
                            long! 
                            <br><br>
                            At first I didn&#39;t know how to feel about my sister getting married but once I met
                            Chisom I knew he was the right one for my sister. One thing I can say about Chisom is
                            that I can see the love he has for Sarah sister by the way he values her. I know what I
                            have observed is authentic and genuine. I&#39;m so blessed to see them grow together in
                            the Lord.&quot;</p>
